Hat: Simple management for personal photos

What's in the hat?
This is a class project I did at The George Washington University in 
spring 2011 when I was a master student in Computer Science. A simple 
central management system is proposed to manage personal photos on the 
heterogeneous storage. 

A prototype software with three command-line processes is design and 
implemented as a proof-of-concept.
