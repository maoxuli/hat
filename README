Hat: Simple management for personal photos

What's in the hat?
This is a class project I did at The George Washington University in 
spring 2011 when I was a master student in Computer Science. A simple 
central management system is proposed to manage personal photos on the 
heterogeneous storage. 

A prototype software with three command-line processes is design and 
implemented as a proof-of-concept. Communications between software 
modules are based on Zero Ice, a ORB (Object Request Broker) style 
communication framework. OpenCV and ImageMagik are used to read image 
files, extract meta-data, and calculate characteristic data like hash 
and histogram. Central database (realized with SQLite) collects 
characteristic data of photos, realizes advanced search and analysis 
of identical or similar photos. Based on which, advance functions of 
photos management, such as deduplication or automatic duplication for 
backup is possible.
